analyzer

This module contains two classes for analyzing text data
from WhatsApp chats: LexicalAnalyzer and WhatsappAnalyzer.

LexicalAnalyzer extracts relevant information from WhatsApp messages,
such as date, time, author, message text, and emojis. 
It processes a text file containing a WhatsApp chat and 
stores the messages in a Chat object, 
which can be retrieved with the get_chat() method.

WhatsappAnalyzer uses LexicalAnalyzer to analyze a WhatsApp chat
and compute various metrics such as the number of messages
and the most frequent words and emojis used by each author.
The results are then displayed using a WhatsappResult object.

Dependencies: standard python modules (collections, datetime, os, re),
downloaded packages (nltk), own module (models, results).
